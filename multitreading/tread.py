# a tread is unit of execution on concurret programming
# multitreading is a technique which allows us to excecute many task of one process at the same time

# what is process?

# a process is basically the program in execution
# for example: when u start an appilication in your computer like a browser or text editor the opperating system creates a process

# what is multitreading in python?
# multitreads maybe excecute intivitually while sharing their process resorses
# purpose of multitreading is to run multiple task and function cells at the same time

# use of multitreading
# if we use multitreading properly your appilication speed performance and rentering can all be improved

# treading classifications

# treading can be classified into 2 types
# 1)single
# in single treading process only one flow of control exists
# 2)multitreading
# in multitreading programs yhe same functions and same resorses maybe accessed concurrently by several flow of control
