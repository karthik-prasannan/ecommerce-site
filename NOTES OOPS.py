# OOPS() : 1) stands for object oriented programming
#          2) OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easly
#          3) it helps to write cleaner code and to maintain control over the function and modules

# OOPS works on the principle of :
# class , object , abstaction , encapsulation , polymorphism , inheritance

# Advantages of using OOPS concept
# 1)modularity : oop allows you to break a large program into smaller which makes it easier to maintain and debug
# 2)reusability: oop allow you to reuse code by creating objects and classes that can be used in different parts of a program
#   this reduses the amount of code you need to write
# 3)easy to maintain: oops that makes code easier to maintain because it is organised in modular and reusable way
